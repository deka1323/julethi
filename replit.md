# Julethi Boutique - E-Commerce Application

## Overview
A modern React-based e-commerce platform for a boutique specializing in bridal, fusion, and occasion wear. The application features a product catalog, admin dashboard, and shopping experience.

## Project Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1 with Vite 5.4.2
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Framer Motion for animations
- **State Management**: Redux with Redux Thunk
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v7
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Components**: Swiper for carousels

### Backend Configuration
- **Original Design**: AWS DynamoDB with Lambda functions
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB (setup guide included)
- **API**: AWS API Gateway endpoints (requires configuration)
- **Alternative**: Supabase client library installed

### Current Setup
- Frontend runs on port 5000 with HMR enabled
- Redux actions fully integrated with dispatch() throughout the application
- API service layer connected to all components (Shop, Admin Dashboard, Product Management)
- Products load from backend API when available, fallback to initial mock data
- Admin authentication is hardcoded (username: admin, password: admin123)
- All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) integrated with productActions.js

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables (for AWS Backend)
```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=<your-api-gateway-url>
```

### AWS Setup
See `AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for complete DynamoDB and Lambda setup instructions.
See `databaseArch.txt` for database schema and access patterns.
See `lambda-functions.js` for Lambda function implementations.

## Local Development
The application runs on Replit with Vite dev server on port 5000.

### Admin Credentials (Demo)
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## Recent Changes (October 15, 2025)
### Initial Setup
- Configured Vite for Replit environment (0.0.0.0:5000, HMR with WSS protocol)
- Set up development workflow on port 5000
- Configured HMR to use REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN for proper WebSocket connection
- Configured deployment settings (autoscale with build and preview)
- Project successfully running in Replit with full hot module replacement

### Backend Integration (Latest)
- **Shop Page**: Integrated `fetchAllProducts()` dispatch on component mount
  - Added loading states for better UX
  - Products load from API when backend is configured
  - Category filtering works with local state
  
- **Admin Overview**: Integrated `fetchAllProducts()` on dashboard load
  - Real-time statistics calculation from fetched products
  - Category distribution charts
  - Recent products display
  - Loading state during data fetch

- **Admin ProductList**: 
  - Integrated `fetchAllProducts()` on component mount
  - Connected `deleteProduct()` async action with error handling
  - Category filtering and search functionality
  - Loading states and empty states

- **Add Product Page**:
  - Replaced local dispatch with `createProduct()` async action
  - Proper error handling and user feedback
  - Form validation
  - Loading states during submission
  - Navigates to product list on success

- **Edit Product Page**:
  - Fixed `updateProduct()` to use correct parameters (productId, productData)
  - Added error handling and loading states
  - Form pre-population from existing product data
  - Proper navigation on success

All components now use the proper async actions from `productActions.js` which integrate with the backend API service layer. The app gracefully falls back to initial mock data when backend is not configured.

## Next Steps
1. Connect to backend API (AWS or Supabase)
2. Implement environment variables for API endpoints
3. Replace hardcoded authentication with real API integration
4. Set up image storage (AWS S3 or similar)
5. Configure deployment settings

## Notes
- The application is currently frontend-only with mock data
- Backend infrastructure diagrams and Lambda functions are included for AWS deployment
- Supabase client is installed as an alternative to AWS services
